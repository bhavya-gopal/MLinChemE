### Example 2

Finding mean and standard deviation for 100 values randomly generated. <br>

### Example 3
Concentration along a PFR is given by, <br>

Solve to find ‘C’ for reactor volumes range of 1 to 10 liters. 



### Example 4

The transient response of a completely mixed reactor with five components can be modelled as

Suppose that at t=0 all the concentrations in the reactors are at zero. Write a MATLAB script
to compute how their concentrations will change over the next 250 seconds. <br>

Plot the time versus concentration profile.
